<h1>ABOUT ME:</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hello there!<br/>I am a College student studying at NIT Silchar, Assam, India <br/>
As of writing this ,I have completed my second semester and I'm currently working on building my technical skills whether it may be through projects or late night coding sessions. 
I really enjoy working with peers and building relations through team effort. I mainly code in C++ and Python and  now I am learning Web Development <br/>
</p>

<p>Although there isn't much to write about myself currently as this is my first capstone project and maybe I have missed out on writing some details ,I will surely improve my abilities and come back to build an even better project. </p>
<p> Thank you for visiting! Have a nice day!</p>
